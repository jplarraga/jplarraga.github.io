My Website

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is my first personal website applying all the knowledge I've had so far related to CSS and HTML and the use of Bootstrap to boost the production speed of production.</p>

<h2>Instalation</h2>

  <li>Copy the code of the repository</li>
  <li>On your terminal locate the folder in which you would like to take the files and then press: <strong> git clone </strong> and then paste the code copied on the repository</li>
  <li>Once the files are cloned to the local file, in your terminal write <strong>code .</strong>. this will eventually open VSCode </li>
  <li>Work on the website and apply all the changes needed and when the progress is considerable write in the terminal <strong> git all .</strong> this will appply all the changes</li>
  <li>Write <strong> git commit -m (any text with the changes made) </strong> this will commit all the changes made so far</li>
  <li>Whenever the code is ready to upload it to the repository write <strong>git push origin master</strong>. If it is not the master repository then the code to write is <strong>git push origin main</strong> this is the location of the main branch.
 
 <h2>Usage</h2>
 
 <p>This website is mainly made for contact information purposes and to display all the project repositories I have been working on so far. I will try to upload all the main projects I will be working on this year</p>
